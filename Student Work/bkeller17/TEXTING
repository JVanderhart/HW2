  I ENJOYED THE METHOD BEHIND THIS PROBLEM AND I LIKED WORKING THROUGH THE POSSBILITIES.
  NEVERTHELESS, I RAN INTO TROUBLE WITH THIS ONE. 
  
  I QUICKLY FOUND OUT THAT, UNLIKE YOU EXAMPLE, THIS WOULD HAVE A VERY LARGE RESULT AND WOULD NOT BE AN EASY THING TO 
  TINKER WITH UNTIL MY CODE WAS SET. THE BIGGEST ISSUE I RAN INTO WAS THE CONCEPT OF STACKING WITHIN EACH RESULT PRINTED.
  FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE "204" EXAMPLE, THE LETTER "a" WAS REPEATED THREE TIMES AND THIS ONE ONLY HAD TWO VALID INTEGERS INPUTTED.
  WHEN I BEGAN WORKING WITH FULL 3-DIGIT COMBINATIONS, AND EVEN 5-DIGIT INPUTS, I NOTICED THE REPITION TREND. 
  
  WHEN I BEGAN THINKING OF CODE AND BRAINSTORMING DIFFERENT APPROACHES, THESE ARE THE THINGS I DEFINITELY KNOW ABOUT THE 
  PROBLEM:
  
      - WE WILL NEED A SCANNER TO SIFT THROUGH THE INPUT AND IDENTIFY 0 AND 1 VALUES
      - AN ARRAY OF CHARACTERS <-> VALUES WILL BE NEEDED
      - A LOOP (I CHOSE FOR) OR A RECURSIVE METHOD WILL BE NEEDED TO RE-RUN EACH INPUT TO SHOW THE DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES
      
  I FOUND THAT IT WORKS BEST TO START WITH THE SEVENTH INTEGER AND ROTATE WITH THOSE THREE VALUES TO KEEP ORDER.
