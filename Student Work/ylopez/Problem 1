//When I run the code, the right side of my box is not actually a straight line. I understand what the process of getting that
//to work is, but I am unsure how to code that. Basically, depending on the number of characters in the word and however long
//the top/bottom of the box, you take that length - the number of characters = number of spaces needed to make the box look
//like a real box
